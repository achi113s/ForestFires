# Forest Fires

In this project we are going to analyze forest fire burn area, location, and meteorological data in order to predict the area of burned forest in the Montesinho Natural Park in the northeast region of Portugal.

The dataset used in this project is from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. As required, here is the citation for the dataset:
